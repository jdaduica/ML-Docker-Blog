## Welcome
Hello and welcome! I’m excited to share my journey in the world of data science through this blog. As someone with a background in biochemistry, I’ve transitioned into the data science field, and I’m eager to explore the endless possibilities that this dynamic field offers. In this space, I’ll be diving into everything from machine learning techniques and data visualization tools to deployment strategies and best practices.

Whether you’re a fellow data science enthusiast or just starting to explore this field, I hope you’ll find valuable insights here. I’ll also be sharing personal experiences, challenges, and tips I’ve picked up along the way. Stay tuned for tutorials, code breakdowns, and discussions on the latest trends in data science and machine learning.

Thank you for reading!
